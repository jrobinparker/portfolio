# about
As a huge fan 80's movies & music, retro tech, and cyberpunk, I thought it would be fun to integrate these styles into my portfolio. I created this React app with background graphics and animations using react-three-fiber, a React renderer for three.js, and a car model created with Vectary. The retro-style PC windows are animated with GSAP.
