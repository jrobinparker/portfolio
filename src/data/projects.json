      "about": "Every year I help support the A/V elements of the annual New Hire Orientation event, including the mobile app, which includes useful information for attendees. The event project leaders wanted usage statistics for a better understanding of the ROI of the app. Unfortunately, reporting on this data was limited, and could only be exported as deeply-nested JSON. I created a data visualization dashboard to present analysis of usage data with Pandas, Bokeh, Flask, and a user-friendly React front-end that provided actionable insights into app usage, reducing following year's app cost by 35%.",

While employee resumes are posted on the corporate intranet, the search engine does not index the contents of them. I used natural language processing tools and Pandas to analyze employee resumes for specific keywords, delivering higher quality employee metrics for case staffing and reducing search times by 100%.",

      "about": "The need for language speakers data continued to grow as Analysis Group expanded internationally. We did not have a reporting solution to obtain on language data, making case staffing for international projects and pitches to new clients difficult. Using Selenium and Beautiful Soup to scrape intranet profiles and Pandas to build the spreadsheet, I developed an app to get language proficiency data from 1000+ employee profiles, providing essential data for international projects and marketing initiatives. This also drastically decreased reporting bottlenecks, optimized case staffing turn-around times by 50%, and saved approximately $2000 week in employee time costs.ã€€I also ported this to a GUI in tkinter for my teammates so they could easily run reports as needed.",

      "about": "This summer, as we were building out the training program for summer interns, a number of trainers mentioned the need to be able to combine course content from separate courses into one large course. Our learning management system, Docebo, does not allow course instructors or admins to download video content through the browser. On top of that, the screen recording program used by the LMS only saves recorded videos to the server, so instructors had no way to upload their created content into new courses. I created an app that connects to the API and allows users to easily download course content. This app saved instructors from having to recreate videos from scratch, and allowed us to quickly create custom courses for the intern training program using existing content.",
